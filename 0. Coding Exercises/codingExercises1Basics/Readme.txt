# Coding Exercises for Java.

## Task-1: Time Converter
* Create a Java program to convert hours & days into minutes.
* create Java Class with name ## TimeConverter
* Create 2 Java Methods
	## convertHoursToMinutes(int hours): This method should take an integer value representing hours and return the equivalent value in minutes.
	## convertDaysToMinutes(int days): This method should take an integer value representing days and return the equivalent value in minutes.
				  
**Instructions**:
* Step 1: Complete the convertHoursToMinutes method in the TimeConverter class so that it accurately converts hours into minutes. The method should return an integer value representing the total number of minutes.

* Step 2: Complete the convertDaysToMinutes method in the TimeConverter class so that it accurately converts days into minutes. The method should return an integer value representing the total number of minutes.

* NOTE: Return -1 for invalid cases (days and hours less than 0).

## Task-2: Exam Result Checker 
* Create a Java program to respond with status as pass or fail.
* create Java Class with name ## ExamResult
* Create 2 Java Methods
	## isPass(int marks)
				  
**Instructions**:
* Step 1: if the marks are greater than 50 (indicating the student has passed).
* Step 2: false otherwise (indicating the student has failed).
* Step 3: Be sure to consider edge cases such as a student scoring exactly 50 marks.

## Task-3: Sum of Squares of First N Numbers
* An integer number N is given. Implement a method ## calculateSumOfSquares in the class ##SumOfSquares that calculates and returns the sum of squares of all positive integers up to n (inclusive).
				  
**Instructions**:
* Step 1: The incomplete code provided contains a class named SumOfSquares with a method signature public long calculateSumOfSquares(int n).
* Step 2: Complete this method to calculate the sum of squares of all positive integers up to n. If n is less than 0, return -1.
* Step 3: Do not print anything in your code. The method should return the sum or -1.
	public class SumOfSquares {
    	public long calculateSumOfSquares(int n) {
       		// write your code here
    	}
	}
