# Coding Exercises for Java.

## Task: Build Calculator
* Create a Java program that provides below menu for the operations that can be performed:
	1. Calculate Factorial
	2. Get last digit of a number
	3. Get Number of Digits in a number
	4. Get Sum of Digits of a number
	5. Reverse a number
	6. Find LCM of two numbers
	7. GCD of two numbers
	8. exit
* Above logic must run in loop until user selects option "8" for stop running calculator.
* Once an operation is selected, do calculation & print. 
* Also take user input if user want to perform same operation or not, if not exit from the selected operation.

**Instructions**:
* 1. Calculate Factorial
	>If the number is negative, it returns -1. 
	>If the number is zero, it returns 1( as 0!=1).
* 2. Get last digit of a number
	>If the number is negative, it returns -1. 
	>If the number is zero, it returns 0.
* 3. Get Number of Digits in a number
	>If the number is negative, it returns -1. 
	>If the number is zero, it returns 1.
* 4. Get Sum of Digits of a number
	>If the number is negative, it returns -1. 
	>If the number is zero, it returns 0 as the sum of digits.
* 5. Reverse a number
	>If the number is negative, it returns -1 as the reverse of a negative number is undefined. 
	>If the number is zero, it returns 0 as the reverse of 0 is 0.
* 6. Find LCM of two numbers
	>If the number is negative, it returns -1 as the LCM for negative numbers is undefined. 
	>If the number is zero, it returns 0 as the LCM of 0 and any other number is 0.
* 7. GCD of two numbers
	>If either number is negative, returns 1 as the GCD for negative numbers is 1. 
	>If either number is zero, returns 0 as the GCD of 0 and any other number is 0.
	>If two numbers are equal, returns the number as the GCD of two equal numbers is the number itself.
